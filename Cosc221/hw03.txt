Logisim -- graded by correctness 

(1) A BCD to 7 segment code convertor (page 260)
	Input: 1 4-bit binary (for BCD input)
	Ouput: 1 7-segment display
	Description: page 258-260
	Note: use gates only, apply sub circuit

(2) A 4 bit binary to BCD converter
	Input: 4 bit binary 
	Output: 1 hex digit display
	Description: displays 0-9 (valid for a BCD number) and 'E' when the value is not valid
	Note: do not use combinational logic

(3) A 2 bit BCD adder
	Input: 4 4-bit binary (for 2 2-digit BCD inputs)
	Output: 7 hex digit displays - 4 for input; 2 for output value; 1 for output carry
	Description: you may assume that all input are valid
	Note: must use the 1-bit BCD adder as component
 
(4) A counter of bit of 1
	Input: one 8-bit binary
	Output: 1 hex digit display
	Description: display the number of 1s in the input
	Note: do not use combinational logic

(5) An ALU
	Input: two 8-bit binary and one 3-bit selector
	Output:  one 8-bit binary
	Description: ALU in 4.8 Table 4.4 on page 304
	Note: do not use combinational logic
