Homework 5 LC3 
Due: Thursday 06/18/2015

What to submit?
- Online submission (select project #5 in submission page)
- Provide .asm file for each question
- Provide meaningful detailed comments

All programs starts from x3000. They are named as q01.asm, q02.asm ...

The following problems are variations from the original exercises in the textbook.

(1) 6.11 Write an LC-3 assembly program to increment each of the numbers stored in memory location A through location B. The addresses A (x3100) and B (x3111) can be found in memory locations x3030 and x3031. Use q01.hex for testing data.

(2) 7.7 Write an LC-3 assembly program that counts the number of 0s in the valuse stored in x3030 and stores the result into R1. For example, if the value is 0001 0011 0111 0000, then the result is 0000 0000 0000 1010.

(3) 7.18 Write an LC-3 assembly program that compares the length two character strings. If the strings have the same length, the program terminats with the value x0001 in R5. If the first string is longer, then R5 has the value x0011. R5 is x0111 if the second one is longer.  

Redo the previous homework problems in LC-3. 

(4) A % B (A>0, B>0). Store the answer in memory named ANS.

(5) Fast Fact N. Store the answer in memory named ANS.

(6) Redo A%B in (4). This time, instead of A+(-B), create a subroutine called MINUS for subtraction. 

Complete the following new challenges

(7) Write an LC-3 assembly program to count the number of negative values starts from x3030. Those consecutive values will end with a value of xffff. Store the answer in R5. Use q07.hex to test.

*(8) Write an LC-3 assembly program to remove duplicate values starts from x3050. Those consecutive values will end with a value of xffff. Store the answer from x3100. Use q08.hex to test.

**(9) Write an LC-3 assembly program to sort (ascending order) non-negative values starts from x3050. Those consecutive values will end with a value of xffff. The sort must be performed in place. That is, you cannot use any additional memory for the sort operation beyond a few registers and a couple
of extra memory locations.  Use q10.hex to test.
