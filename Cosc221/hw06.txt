- Provide .asm file for each question
- Provide meaningful detailed comments

All programs starts from x3000. They are named as q08.asm, q09.asm q10.asm

*(8) Write an LC-3 assembly program to remove duplicate values starts from x3050. Those consecutive values will end with a value of xffff. Store the answer from x3070. Use q08.hex to test.

**(9) Write an LC-3 assembly program to sort (ascending order) non-negative values starts from x3050. Those consecutive values will end with a value of xffff. The sort must be performed in place. That is, you cannot use any additional memory for the sort operation beyond a few registers and a couple
of extra memory locations.  Use q10.hex to test.

*(10) Write an LC-3 assembly program to test if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. The answer is 1 if the input string is a palindrome, -1 otherwise. Use INPUT .STRINGZ for the test string.
